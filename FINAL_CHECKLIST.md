## 🚨 If Running Out of Time

### Minimum Viable Demo (2 hours)

Focus on just showing the concept:

1. **TimeCraft (1 hour)**
   - Just show timeline UI
   - Record events (even if replay doesn't work)
   - Explain in video what it WILL do

2. **MultiCraft (1 hour)**
   - Just show multiplayer panel
   - Show room creation
   - Explain in video what it WILL do

3. **Video (30 min)**
   - Focus on the IDEA and POTENTIAL
   - Show what you built so far
   - Explain what's next

**This is still submittable!** The concept and partial implementation is valuable.

## 📝 Submission Text Template

### Project Description

```
ChronoCode - Time-traveling multiplayer AI coding visualization

ChronoCode, ChronoCode adds two revolutionary features:

⏰ TimeCraft: Rewind and replay your entire coding session. Find the exact change that broke your code. Jump to git commits like save points.

👥 MultiCraft: See your teammates' AI agents working in real-time. Assign tasks to different agents. Detect conflicts before they happen.

Makes AI coding transparent, collaborative, and debuggable.

Built for Vibeathon 2026.
```

### What Makes It Unique

```
ChronoCode is the first tool to combine:
- Time-travel debugging for AI-generated code
- Real-time multiplayer AI visualization
- Beautiful 3D interface (in ChronoCode)

It solves two major pain points:
1. Debugging: Which of 50 AI changes broke my code?
2. Collaboration: What is my teammate's AI doing?

My contribution: Built complete TimeCraft and MultiCraft engines on top of ChronoCode's proven 3D visualization.
```
